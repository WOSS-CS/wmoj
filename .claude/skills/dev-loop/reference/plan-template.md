# dev-loop plan structure

Every plan written in a dev-loop run uses this shape — the three competing plans from Phase 1
and the single merged `plan.md` that survives Phase 2. Written by `sub-planner` and
`plan-orchestrator`, audited against by `sub-plan-auditor` and `plan-auditor`, executed by
`implementation-orchestrator` and `implementer`.

A plan is not an essay about the task. It is the document four agents will execute in
parallel without talking to each other. If two implementers could read a step and write
different code, the step is not finished.

---

## 1. The task, and what "done" means

Restate the task in your own words, then give the acceptance criteria: **observable**
statements a reviewer can check, phrased as what a user or a test can see. "Refactored
cleanly" is not one. "Submitting the form with an empty title shows a field-level error, creates
no row, and the state survives a reload" is.

For a bug fix, the first acceptance criterion is always the reproduction: the exact steps
that show the bug today, and the same steps showing it gone.

## 2. Current state

How this works **today**, with `path:line`. The mechanism, not a summary of the file names —
the flow of control, where state lives, what already handles the case you are about to
change. Name the code you will be standing on.

## 3. Approach, and what you rejected

The approach, and why it is the right one for this codebase specifically — its conventions,
its invariants, its existing seams. Then the alternatives you considered and rejected, each
with the reason. The rejected list is what stops Phase 2 and Phase 4 relitigating a decision
you already thought through.

Weigh quality, simplicity, robustness, and long-term maintainability. Do not weigh how long
it takes to build.

## 4. Work breakdown

Ordered steps. Each step:

- **What changes** — the files, and for each, what happens to it (new / modified / deleted).
- **How** — the actual shape of the change: signatures, types, the data flow, the edge cases
  it must handle. Concrete enough that two implementers would produce the same thing.
- **Why here** — what makes this the right file and the right layer.
- **Depends on** — the steps that must land first, if any.
- **Acceptance** — how someone verifies this step alone is correct.

Group the steps into work packages that can be owned by different agents **without two of
them ever touching the same file**. Shared files — types, barrel exports, migrations,
`AGENTS.md` — belong to exactly one package. Say which.

## 5. Data and schema

If the database changes:

- The migration, as SQL, destined for `supabase/migrations/<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_<description>.sql`.
  Every schema change lands as a file, whether it was applied through the MCP or not.
- RLS policies and grants — including whether a new table is service-role only (zero policies),
  and if so, what enforces that.
- The `lib/types/database.ts` edit, which is hand-maintained and will not update itself.
- What existing rows look like after the change, and whether anything needs backfilling.

If the database does not change, say so explicitly. Silence reads as "nobody checked".

## 6. Tests

What proves this works, at each level:

- **Unit** (`vitest`, node env, over `lib/**` and `tests/**`) — the cases, including the
  failure modes, not just the happy path. `components/**` is not unit-testable here.
- **End-to-end** — the flows Phase 4 must exercise through the real UI, in the order a user
  would hit them.
- **Regression** — what nearby behaviour could plausibly break, and what covers it.

For every test that will assert an absence, say how it proves it can detect a presence: a
check that cannot distinguish "passed" from "did not run" is not a check.

## 7. Invariants at risk

The load-bearing rules from `AGENTS.md` and from the code that this change comes near, each
with: what it is, why it exists, and specifically how this plan avoids breaking it. If the
change touches a subsystem whose invariants `AGENTS.md` lists explicitly, walk that list item
by item.

## 8. Documentation

What `AGENTS.md` must say after this change that it does not say now — new subsystem, new
convention, new invariant, or an existing line this change makes stale. Keeping it current is
part of the change, not a follow-up.

## 9. Risks, unknowns, rollback

What could go wrong, how likely, what it would look like when it does, and what to do about
it. What you could not determine from the code and how the implementer should resolve it. How
to undo this if it turns out to be wrong.

## 10. Out of scope

What this change deliberately does not do, and why. This is the boundary Phase 4 uses to tell
a real finding from scope creep, so be specific — vagueness here becomes an extra review
iteration later.
